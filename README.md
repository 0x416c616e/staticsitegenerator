## Alan's static site generator made with Python and Qt

This project is intended to be an alternative to Jekyll for generating static blogs and landing pages. It will be made with Python 3.x and Qt. It is very much a work in progress.

## Currently command-line only

The first version of this program will be command-line only. Later, I will add GUI support. But that will come only after the basic text-based version is done.
