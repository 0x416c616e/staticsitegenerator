THIS FOLDER IS NOT DONE YET.

This is where the finished page json files will go.

What do I mean by that?

By pages, I do not mean individual article pages. I mean the 1-5 article preview pages, such as index.html,
or page 2, or page 3.

If you have 15 articles, there will be 3 pages: index, page2, and page3.

If you have a number of articles not divisible by 5, such as 19, all the pages except the last page will have 5,
and then the last page will have the remainder. With 19, the last page will have 4. That means it will use
4_article_page.json from json_templates and 4_articles.html from html_page_templates.

the files in page_json are not templates. They are based on the json templates, but have their values replaced.

index.json is the json for the index page. It is the only page that is guaranteed to exist.

If the user has 5 or fewer articles, index.json will be based on the templates for having fewer than 5 articles.

order.txt is a file for having every article on a separate line, from oldest to newest, denoting the order of the
articles on the site. When an article is deleted and then the site is regenerated, order.txt needs to be recomputed.

index.json is the only file that is guaranteed to exist. If you have more pages, they will be something like
page2.json, page3.json, and so on. Think of index.json as basically page1.json, but given the special name index.html
because a lot of web servers specifically look for a file called index.html and that's what they serve
when the user goes to a domain name with no extension and so special "routes" or redirects on a backend platform.
