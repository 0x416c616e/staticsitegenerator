By default, when a project is first copied, it will be blank and not suitable for immediate use before
doing the initial setup module stuff to configure a few basic tasks. Some is automatic, some is
prompting the user for input for certain settings and links and whatnot.

The file called 'finished_initial_setup.txt' contained a string that should be converted to a boolean.
Then you can see the status of whether or not the project has finished the initial setup.
This is checked because the user could close out or hit ctrl+c before finishing the setup process.
If they do not finish the setup, the boolean in finished_initial_setup will still be False.
If they complete it, it will be changed to True.

If, upon loading a project, the finished_initial_setup.txt is still False, it will immediately go into the
initial setup.

See the info.txt files in each subfolder to see what they're for.
