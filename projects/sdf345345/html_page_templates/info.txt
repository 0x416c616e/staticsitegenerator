This directory is for the template files that all projects are based on.

When you create a new project, it copies all the template files to a subdirectory in the projects file, with project_name
as specified from the user.

You can edit templates, if you want. It is not advised that you edit master templates from the template folder.

It is advised to only edit individual project templates within projects/project_name/template

Do not edit the templates unless you know what you are doing.

The template files are combined with the appropriate json files in order to generate the final static site pages,
which are placed in the website_files folder. Do not upload json or template files to your site. Only website_files.
