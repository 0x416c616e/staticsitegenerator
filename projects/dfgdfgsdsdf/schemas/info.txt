For now, there are no JSON schemas or validators. Just assume the JSON files will be properly structured. This kind of assumption can cause problems, but for now, I have too many other features to make for the minimum viable product.

In the future, this is the directory where the schema files will go, for use with pip's jsonschema module. But not until the other aspects of the program are finished first.
